"""Topic auto-replies for Gmail — the writer.

The owner picks ONE of their agents to write topic replies. That agent's model
writes; Flight Deck builds every byte the model sees and runs every lookup. No
chat frame is ever sent, so no session, lane, transcript, memory layer,
insight extraction or automation kind ever sees the email. The email reaches
the agent only as the messages of two ``POST /api/llm/complete`` calls (a
scoped provider copy: no tools, memory or session) and as query strings inside
``run_tool`` args.

* **Agent resolution** (:func:`resolve_writer`, at use time): the ref's record
  must be the owner's own, not a Flight Deck–managed worker, and have a token
  and a port; a stopped agent means "wait". A shared agent may write, but its
  insights and playbooks are never used: the commons mixes in its members'
  learnings. :func:`list_eligible_agents` is the picker's list.
* **Primitives.** :func:`_agent_complete` (the agent's model, no
  ``temperature`` so its quirk self-healing applies; a truncated answer is a
  failure) and :func:`_agent_tool` (ONE catalogue tool through the agent's
  ``run_tool`` frame, always with :data:`LOOKUP_MARKER`: mail writes denied).
* **Brokered lookups.** Only this module emits a tool call, from a fixed
  catalogue: the topic folder (read and searched here, FD-side), ``insights``
  search in the ``fact`` and ``workflow`` categories only, ``playbooks``
  search, ``web_search``. The model only proposes query strings, and each one
  is cleaned, capped and anchored to the topic; no query the pre-scan flags
  (a never-disclose term, an ID …) ever leaves Flight Deck.
* **Folder index** (:func:`build_folder_index`): regular, non-hidden files
  inside the topic folder only, each chunk pre-scanned by
  :func:`outbound_guard.scan_material`; a chunk with a hit is hidden and
  counted, with the text around it. A file whose NAME the pre-scan flags is
  hidden whole, and the headings listed to the planner are scanned too.
* **Pipeline** (:func:`compose_reply`): W1 lookup plan, W2 lookups, W3 the
  reply in a nonce envelope (:func:`parse_envelope`).

What the writer sees is the topic's name, about and brief, the folder
excerpts (SHAREABLE), the background lookups (not cleared for sharing), the
thread messages the sender already saw and the sender's own email — the
classifier's and the judge's own view of it, never a character more. Never
other topics, ``not_this``, the never-disclose list, the agent's persona,
the owner's profile, or any memory. Characters a reader can't see never
stay in any of it, nor in the reply (:func:`_visible`): what the guard scans
is what is shown and sent.

Never logs email text, queries, file contents, a token or a reply.
