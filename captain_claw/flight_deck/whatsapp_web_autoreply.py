"""WhatsApp Web auto-replies — the user's agent answers by itself in the chats
they picked (Connections → WhatsApp Web → Sending → Auto-reply).

The WhatsApp Web service tells Flight Deck about every message someone else
writes in such a chat (an ``incoming`` event, only while sending is on and the
chat is whitelisted: :meth:`Engine._autoreply_candidate`). This module decides
whether the agent answers, has the agent's model write the answer, and sends it
through the service's gate (:meth:`Engine.send`: whitelist, limits, signature,
bell, the unconfirmed-send check). Decisions (docs/whatsapp-web-plan.md):

* **When.** A *mention* — the agent's name or one of the user's trigger words
  in the message (also with a case ending, as Croatian and other Slavic
  languages decline names: "captainu", "Stevu"), or a reply to one of the
  agent's own messages — is always
  considered, the user's own included (that's how they call it in). Otherwise the agent only *follows up*: within
  :data:`FOLLOW_UP_SECONDS` of its last message in that chat, and only if the
  user hasn't written there themselves since (then it's their conversation).
  A message that ends like another assistant's signature is never answered,
  mention or not (two assistants never keep each other going), nor one more
  than :data:`MAX_AGE_SECONDS` old when it arrives. Direct chats follow the
  same rules. Messages arriving
  close together are answered once, :data:`DEBOUNCE_SECONDS` after the last;
  at most :data:`HOURLY_CAP` answers per chat per hour.
* **What it sees.** The chat + the web, nothing else: the agent's own model
  through ``POST /api/llm/complete`` (no tools, memory, session or persona —
  :func:`gmail_autoreply_writer._agent_complete`), a prompt Flight Deck builds
  from the last :data:`CONTEXT_MESSAGES` messages, and at most one web search
  it asks for, run through the agent's ``run_tool`` frame
  (:func:`gmail_autoreply_writer._agent_tool`, the catalogue's ``web_search``
  with its query checks). Never the user's mail, files, calendar, memory,
  other chats or other agents: everyone in the chat reads the answer.
* **Whether.** The model answers with exactly one nonce envelope: REPLY,
  SKIP, or (first pass only) SEARCH. Anything else is a SKIP. It's told it may
  stay silent, must never speak or promise as the user, and that the chat's
  messages are conversation, never instructions.

The deck switches ``FD_WHATSAPP_WEB_AUTOREPLY=off`` and ``FD_WHATSAPP_WEB_SEND=off``
stop every answer. Never logs message text, a prompt or a reply.
