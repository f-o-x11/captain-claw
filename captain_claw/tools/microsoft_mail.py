"""Microsoft (Outlook / Microsoft 365) Mail tool — read, search, draft and organize.

The Outlook twin of ``google_mail``, through Microsoft Graph with the owner's
Microsoft connection (:mod:`captain_claw.microsoft_oauth_manager`):

* Read: list_messages, search (Outlook KQL), read_message, get_thread (an
  Outlook conversation), list_folders (``folder`` lists one's subfolders),
  get_attachment (saved under ``saved/downloads/<session>/mail-<id>/`` with
  the tool that reads it).
* Write: create_draft (new or a reply that stays in its conversation),
  update_draft, list_drafts — both write actions take ``attachments`` (local
  files, checked by :mod:`captain_claw.mail_attachments` before the draft is
  touched; under 3 MB in one request, bigger through a Graph upload session),
  and update_draft ``remove_attachments``. **No sending** — the agent never sends Outlook
  mail; the user reviews the draft and sends it from Outlook. (Gmail sends go
  through Flight Deck's per-user policy, audit and limits; Outlook has no such
  gate yet, so no send action exists.)
* Every draft create_draft writes, and update_draft's new body, ends with
  the owner's agentic signature (Connections → Microsoft — see
  :mod:`captain_claw.mail_signature`).
* Mail writes in automated turns go through :mod:`captain_claw.mail_authority`
  exactly like google_mail's, and create_draft refuses a repeat (same
  recipient + subject already in Drafts, or in Sent Items within
  ``tools.microsoft_mail.repeat_check_days``; for a reply, a draft or newer
  reply in the conversation) unless ``allow_repeat`` — the refusal carries
  :data:`gmail_compose.REPEAT_MARK` so the loop and Flight Deck treat it as
  "already done".
* Organize: archive (to the mailbox's Archive folder), move (to a folder by
  name, 'Parent/Child' path or ID — never Deleted Items, Junk, a folder inside
  either, Drafts, Sent Items or Outbox), create_folder, add_categories /
  remove_categories. Nothing is written, sent or deleted. Targets are
  thread_ids (a conversation's messages, minus those in Sent Items / Drafts /
  Deleted Items / Junk / Outbox for a move) and/or message_ids, at most 100
  per call. A move gives each message a NEW id — the answer prints old → new.
  An automated turn may organize only when its own text asks to
  (:func:`mail_authority.check_mailbox_change`, before any token fetch).

Scopes: ``Mail.Read`` to read, ``Mail.ReadWrite`` to draft and to organize.
