// Voice notes recorded while the device can't reach Flight Deck (no Wi-Fi,
// or the deck is down), kept in internal flash (LittleFS) as 8 kHz 4-bit
// ADPCM (adpcm.h): 4 KB a second, so the flash holds about a quarter of an
// hour — or, on the PaperColor with a microSD card in, on the card (hours;
// notes left in flash move there at start-up). Once the deck is back — and the user said yes — they go up together
// as plain PCM and become one turn for the agent, marked as recorded offline
// (device_bridge.py). Notes kept by older firmware (16 kHz WAV) still go up.
