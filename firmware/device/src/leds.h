// Status lights (PaperColor: two RGB LEDs). The paper takes ~20 s to redraw,
// so the lights say what's happening now: red blinking while it records you
// (like a REC light, brighter when you're louder), a blink for every step
// the deck reports while the agent works — light blue for a tool, dark blue
// for narration and progress, purple for the model thinking — green with the voice
// while it speaks, a soft white glow while the paper redraws, purple blinks
// left and right in turn, one a second, while an update downloads. Starting up,
// the left light shows Wi-Fi and the right one the agent; idle, a short blink
// every 10 s says how close sleep is. Devices without lights ignore all of it.
